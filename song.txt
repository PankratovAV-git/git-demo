Rilkean heart I looked for you
To give me transcendent experiences
To transport me out of self and aloneness
And alienation into a sense of
One-ness and connection ecstatic and magical
I became a junkie for it
I came looking for the next high
And I'm sorry
I've been putting the search on the wrong place
I understand that you're confused
Feeling overwhelmed
